Call of Duty Mobile is a game played by millions of gamers around the world and not excluding Africa. 

TheRepublic is a gaming community in Africa that has hosted in the last 2 years, Call of Duty Mobile tournaments weekly in sub saharan Africa to showcase the top teams and players in Africa.
Being a competitive gamer in Africa, I noticed there was never a proper analysis done amongst Esport Players.
I have collected the data from one of the tournaments and came up with a ranking system to show the top players in that particular tournament.

The tournament was in the Multiplayer mode in the game of Hardpoint(HP) and Search and Destroy (SnD). Teams that tie this round, settle in a Domination(Dom) and join the other teams in proceeding to the next round of the tournaments.

The Top Ranking Players were

Simpzy - 6.80KD,  65 kills and 10 assists
