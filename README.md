# Esportsranking
Call of Duty Mobile is a game played by millions of gamers around the world and not excluding Africa. 

TheRepublic is a gaming community in Africa that has hosted in the last 2 years, Call of Duty Mobile tournaments weekly in sub saharan Africa to showcase the top teams and players in Africa.
Being a competitive gamer in Africa, I noticed there was never a proper analysis done amongst Esport Players.
I have collected the data from one of the tournaments and came up with a ranking system to show the top players in that particular tournament.
